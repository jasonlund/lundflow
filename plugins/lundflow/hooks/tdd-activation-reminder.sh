[tdd-router] This prompt looks like NEW FEATURE / implementation work — the
trigger for the `tdd` skill (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR).

Before writing ANY implementation or hand-authoring tests, walk this check in order:

  1. Did the user invoke a DIFFERENT skill in THIS message?
       YES -> follow that skill; stop here.
       NO  -> continue.

  2. Did the user explicitly say this is NOT TDD work / not to use the skill in
     THIS message?
       YES -> proceed normally; stop here.
       NO  -> continue.

  3. Neither applies -> invoke the `tdd` skill NOW, FIRST.

Let the skill drive the cycle: a failing RED slice approved before code, then
GREEN, then REFACTOR — each phase in its isolated subagent. Do NOT jump straight
to writing implementation, and do NOT hand-write tests outside the skill.
