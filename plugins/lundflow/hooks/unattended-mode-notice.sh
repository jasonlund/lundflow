# Fires only when the hook payload's `permission_mode` is exactly
# `bypassPermissions` (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`), where nobody is watching
# and a skill's human-approval gate would stall the run forever. Injects a notice
# so the agent skips the ask-a-human gates while every correctness gate still holds.
#
# Detection FAILS CLOSED: an absent field, an unparseable payload, a missing jq, or
# any other mode all mean no notice, leaving the gated (attended) path in force.
# The asymmetry is the point — a false positive strips a human's approval from a
# loop that writes code, while a false negative only asks a question that was going
# to be asked anyway.
#
# It only NOTIFIES (stdout -> added context); it never blocks. Exit 0 always.

# was checked. `-s` slurps the whole stream into one array, so this is the only

[unattended-mode] permission_mode=bypassPermissions — this session runs unattended.
Three ask-a-human approval gates, and only these three, do NOT apply: the `tdd` Step 1
RED plan card, tdd-feedback's route confirmation, review-tdd-cross-slice's sweep
approval. Write the contract to chat and proceed. The planning skills (plan-draft,
plan-breakdown, plan-slices) stay gated — the interview is the work. Every correctness
gate still applies — RED must fail for the right reason, GREEN must pass,
REFACTOR must stay green.
