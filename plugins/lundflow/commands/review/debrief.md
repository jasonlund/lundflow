description: Debrief on the branch that was just built — diffs it, summarizes in plain language what the PR does, checks it against the Linear ticket flagging any deviation from scope, and hands the author the Linear diff link to review.

# Review Debrief

You are running the **debrief** stage of the review loop:
`/review:create-pr` → **`/review:debrief`** → `/review:human` → `/review:suite`
(or `/review:claude`) → `/review:add` → `/review:process`.

The branch is already built when you run, so this is a debrief and not a brief:
you account for work that happened, then hand the author the diff to read.

This stage is for the **human**, not the machine. Before the adversarial
multi-agent engines burn tokens finding defects, give the author a plain-language
readout of *what this branch actually does* and *how it lines up with the ticket
it claims to close*. The single most important output is **scope deviation**: work
that shipped but the ticket never asked for, and acceptance criteria the ticket
asked for but the diff doesn't deliver.

You **do not** post anything to GitHub, run linters/tests, or spawn reviewer
subagents. You read, you compare, you tell the user. Keep it conversational — this
is a debrief, not a `=== FINDING ===` report.

## Input
- **PR number** — positional arg, or auto-detected from the current branch.
- **Ticket ID** — `FLIX-XXX`, positional arg, or extracted from the branch / PR
  title.

Both are optional when the branch has an open PR. See Phase 0.

## Example Invocation
```
/review:debrief                 # auto-detect PR + ticket from branch
/review:debrief 205             # explicit PR, auto-detect ticket
/review:debrief FLIX-205        # auto-detect PR, explicit ticket
/review:debrief 205 FLIX-205    # explicit both
```

## Phase 0: Resolve PR + Ticket

1. **PR number** — if not passed, follow **PR Number Auto-Extraction** in
   `.claude/skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md`. A PR is **not required** — if none
   exists, fall back to the local branch (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`) and note
   in the report that there's no open PR yet (suggest `/review:create-pr`).
2. **Ticket ID** — if not passed, follow **Ticket ID Auto-Extraction** in the same
   contract (branch name → PR title → null). If null, run the summary anyway and
   state plainly that ticket-alignment is **skipped** — there's nothing to check
   scope against.

---

## Phase 1: Gather the Change

Ground the readout in the same three sources `/review:create-pr` uses — **read them, do
not guess**:

| Source | Supplies | How |
|---|---|---|
| Diff | the *what* — actual changes | `gh pr diff {PR}` if a PR exists, else `git diff origin/main...HEAD` |
| Commits | the *narrative* / ordering | `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` |
| Ticket | the *why* — intent + acceptance criteria | `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` when a ticket ID is set |

Assert the diff is non-empty. Note added / modified / deleted files. If the diff
is large (> ~500 lines), lead with the highest-signal files and say you're
summarizing the rest.

If the Linear MCP is unavailable, say so and run the summary without alignment
(don't invent the ticket's contents).

---

## Phase 2: Summarize What We Did

Write a tight, plain-language account of the branch — the way you'd brief a
teammate looking at it for the first time. Group by **concern**, not by file:
"adds X action", "wires Y into the Filament panel", "backfills the Z column". Name
the key classes/files so the reader can jump in. Present tense, house style —
prose first, a short bullet list only if the change spans several distinct
concerns.

This is not a changelog dump of every hunk. It's *what the branch accomplishes*.

---

## Phase 3: Check Against the Ticket

Only if a ticket ID resolved and its contents loaded. Compare the diff against the
ticket's description and acceptance criteria and sort every material change into:

- **✅ On scope** — a change the ticket asked for. (Summarize, don't enumerate
  every line.)
- **⚠️ Deviation — shipped, not in the ticket** — code in this branch that no
  acceptance criterion covers. Reasonable incidental work (a rename, a lint fix)
  is fine to note lightly; a whole feature the ticket never mentioned is a real
  deviation, call it out.
- **❌ Gap — in the ticket, not shipped** — an acceptance criterion the diff
  doesn't appear to satisfy. Say which, and where you'd expect to see it.

For each deviation and gap, give the file(s) and a one-line why-it-matters. Don't
moralize — surface it and let the author decide.

Per the CLAUDE.md Linear rule (*"work deviates → confirm first, then update the
ticket and mark it a deviation"*), close this phase by reminding the user to
reconcile any real deviation on the ticket **before** merge — either fold it into
scope or split it out.

---

## Phase 4: Debrief the User

Print a conversational debrief (this is the whole deliverable — nothing is
posted):

```markdown
# Review Debrief: PR #{number}{ against {ticket_id} if present}

## What this branch does
{plain-language summary from Phase 2}

## Ticket alignment
{✅ on-scope / ⚠️ deviations / ❌ gaps from Phase 3 —
 or "No ticket resolved — alignment skipped." }

## Before you read the diff
- {deviations/gaps to reconcile on the ticket, if any}
- {anything that looked off but isn't defect-hunting — that's /review:suite's job}

Diff: https://linear.review/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{n}

Next: /review:human
```

The diff link is the handoff — `/review:human` reviews the branch in Linear, and
resolves the pieces the link needs again when it runs on its own. Build it from the
repo's `owner/name` (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner'`) and
the `{n}` Phase 0 already resolved. Drop the line when no PR is open — there is no
diff to open in Linear yet — and say `/review:create-pr` first instead.

If there are no deviations and no gaps, say so in one line — a clean
ticket-to-diff match is the good outcome, not a reason to manufacture concerns.

## Notes
- **Human-facing only.** No GitHub posting, no linters, no reviewer subagents,
  no commits — this stage informs, the later stages act.
- **Don't defect-hunt.** Correctness/edge-case/convention review is `/review:suite`'s
  job. Staying in your lane keeps this stage fast and cheap. If something genuinely
  alarming jumps out, mention it in one line and defer to the review engines.
- **Ground everything** in the diff, commits, and ticket — never describe work the
  diff doesn't show or ticket scope you didn't read.
