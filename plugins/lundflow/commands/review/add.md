# Add Review to PR

Post the findings from a `/review:claude` report to a GitHub PR as a review with
inline comments.

## Input Source

The review report comes from one of two places:

1. **File path in `$ARGUMENTS`** — if it contains a readable file path, Read that
   file as the report.
2. **Previous message in the conversation** (default) — the most recent
   `/review:claude` output.

Either way the report uses the standard format (Spec, Blocking Issues, Should Fix,
Consider, Nits, Dismissed sections). A report from an engine that reviews
standards only (CodeRabbit) carries no Spec section. If no review output is found
in either place, stop and tell the user.

## Phase 1: Extract Review Data

1. **PR number** — from the report header (`PR Review: PR #NNN …`). If absent,
   fall back to `gh pr view --json number --jq .number` for the current branch.
2. **Source** — an optional `Source:` line just under the header names the review
   engine (e.g. `Source: CodeRabbit`, `Source: /review:claude`).
   Capture it as `{source}`; if absent, default to `` `/review:claude` ``. Use it in
   the body header and per-finding footers below so the posted review is
   attributed to the engine that produced it.
3. **Repo** — `gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '{owner: .owner.login, repo: .name}'`.
4. **Parse findings** from these sections. Every posted finding belongs to one of
   two **axes** — `spec` (does it do what the ticket asked) and `standards` — and
   keeps that axis through Phases 2–4:
   - **Spec — does it do what the ticket asked?** → axis `spec`. Each entry names
     its own severity: `🔴 BLOCKING` → `critical`, `🟠 SHOULD_FIX` → `major`,
     `🟡 CONSIDER` → `minor`. Its **Violates** field holds the quoted ticket line.
     An entry whose **File** reads `_no file_` (or is absent) is a finding about
     code that does not exist — carry it with no file/line, keep its quoted ticket
     line as the finding's identity (Phase 3, **Body-finding ref key**), and post it
     in the review body per Phase 2.3.
   - **Blocking Issues** → axis `standards`, severity `critical`
   - **Should Fix** → axis `standards`, severity `major`
   - **Consider** → axis `standards`, severity `minor`
   - **Nits** (heading `## Nits (trivial, take them or leave them)`) → axis
     `standards`, severity `minor`, and the `nit` badge from Phase 3. It holds the
     gate NITs — every Pint violation and every ESLint warning — so skipping the
     section drops findings the pipeline paid a gate to produce.
   - Prose lines in place of entries ("Implements the ticket as specified.", "No
     blocking or should-fix defects found.", "No nits.") mean that section has zero
     findings.
   - **Skip "Dismissed Findings"**, **"Key Defects"** (it restates findings the
     severity sections already carry), and **"Coverage Notes"** entirely — do not
     post.
5. For each finding extract: axis, severity, file path, line number(s) (for a range
   `N-M`, use the end line `M` for the API), issue, violation reference,
   recommendation, found-by.

## Phase 2: Determine Commentable Lines

1. Fetch the diff: `gh pr diff {number}`.
2. Parse it into a map of commentable `(file, line)` pairs. GitHub only allows
   inline comments on lines in the diff hunks:
   - Track the file from `+++ b/` headers and line numbers from
     `@@ -old,count +new,count @@` headers.
   - `+` (added) and ` ` (context) lines are commentable on the RIGHT side.
   - `-` (removed) lines are not commentable with `line`.
3. For each finding with a file+line: in the diff → **inline comment**; not in the
   diff → **body comment**. Findings without file/line → **body comment**.

## Phase 3: Build the Review Payload

### Severity badges
| Severity | Badge |
|----------|-------|
| critical | 🔴 **Blocking** |
| major | 🟠 **Should Fix** |
| minor | 🟡 **Consider** |
| minor, from **Nits** | ⚪ **Nit** |

Both axes use this one badge table, and the badge is what `/review:process` ranks
a posted comment by. A **Nits** finding keeps severity `minor` — that is the value
the GitHub API payload carries — and takes its own badge so a trivial gate NIT
reads as optional: `⚪ **Nit** · convention`.

### Axis marker

A `spec` finding fills the category slot with `spec`, so its comment reads
`🟠 **Should Fix** · spec` and the reader sees which axis flagged it. A
`standards` finding fills that slot with its own category (`convention`,
`testing`, …). The badge ranks a finding **within** its axis; the two axes stay
side by side and neither outranks the other.

### Inline comments
For each inline-eligible finding:
```json
{
  "path": "path/to/file.php",
  "line": 50,
  "side": "RIGHT",
  "body": "🔴 **Blocking** · `category`\n\n**Issue:** …\n\n**Violates:** …\n\n**Recommendation:** …\n\n---\n_Found by: agent-name · via {source}_"
}
```
For a range, add `"start_line": <start>` and `"start_side": "RIGHT"` (only when
the start differs from `line`).

### Review body
Open with a header, then the body-only findings — **spec first, under its own
heading**, then the standards ones. The two axes keep separate headings here, so
a reader sees a spec defect even when the standards list is long:
```
## 🤖 Automated Review via {source}

**Inline comments:** {count}
**Additional findings below:** {count}

## Spec — does it do what the ticket asked?

### 🟠 Should Fix · `spec`
**File:** _no file — the ticket line has no implementation_ (ref `no-file:{hash}`)
**Issue:** …
**Violates:** "{quoted ticket line}"
**Recommendation:** …
_Found by: /review:debrief_

---

## Standards

### 🔴 Blocking · `category`
**File:** `path/to/file.php` (lines N-M)
**Issue:** …
**Violates:** …
**Recommendation:** …
_Found by: agent-name_

---
```
Include a heading only when that axis has body findings. If every finding posted
inline, set the body to a one-line note that all N findings are inline above —
naming the spec count separately, e.g. "All 6 findings are inline above (1 spec,
5 standards)."

### Body-finding ref key

Every body finding carries one **ref key** that identifies it across runs.
`/review:process` records the key when it resolves the finding, and the
`review-feedback-collector` it dispatches (its Phase 0 step 3) matches on the key to
skip that finding next run. So two distinct findings must produce two distinct keys,
and the same finding must produce the same key every run.
The format — stated identically in `.claude/commands/review/process.md`:

- **Has a file** → `{file}:{line}`, and `{file}:0` when the finding names no line.
- **No file** → `no-file:{hash}`, where `{hash}` is the first 8 hex characters of
  the SHA-256 of the quoted ticket line in that finding's **Violates** field, taken
  verbatim without the surrounding quote marks:
  ```bash
  printf '%s' '{quoted ticket line}' | shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-8
  ```

The ticket line is what makes a no-file finding unique and it is copied verbatim
from the ticket, so the hash is both finding-specific and stable run to run. Print
the key in that finding's **File** line, as the template above shows, so
`/review:process` reads it rather than recomputing it.

## Phase 4: Post the Review

Write the payload to a temp file (avoids shell-escaping issues), then:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews --method POST --input /tmp/review-payload.json
```
Payload:
```json
{ "event": "COMMENT", "body": "<body>", "comments": [<inline array>] }
```
- Use `event: "COMMENT"` only — never `APPROVE`/`REQUEST_CHANGES` (the user's
  call).
- Delete the temp file after.

## Phase 5: Report Results

```
✅ Review posted to PR #{number}
- {X} inline comments
- {Y} findings in review body
- {S} of the above on the spec axis
- {Z} dismissed findings (not posted)

View: {PR URL}
```

## Error Handling

- If the API rejects an inline position as invalid, move that comment to the
  review body and retry.
- If there are 0 postable findings, say "No non-dismissed findings to post" and
  stop.
- If the call fails entirely, show the error and the payload.
