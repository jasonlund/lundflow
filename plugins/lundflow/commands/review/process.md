name: review:process
description: Third stage after /review:claude → /review:add. Collects un-resolved PR feedback (GitHub inline threads, review-body findings, general comments, Conductor diff-comments), triages it against the Linear ticket and the PR head, presents one numbered list where every item carries your recommendation and its reasoning, takes a reply of overrides while silence accepts every recommendation, dispatches a foreground fixer per approval (parallel file-disjoint waves, test-first, no commit), then replies to and resolves everything it considered and prompts to commit/push.
---

# Process Review Feedback

The final stage of the review loop: `/review:create-pr` → `/review:debrief` →
`/review:human` → `/review:claude` → `/review:add` → **`/review:process`**. You read
back the feedback still open on the PR, settle it with the user in **one gate**,
dispatch isolated fixer subagents, then reply to and resolve everything you considered
so a future run never re-triages it.

Fixing happens in `review-fixer` subagents. You triage, present, dispatch, verify, and
resolve.

## Input

- **PR number** — positional arg, or auto-detected from the current branch.
- **`--leave-human-open`** — reply to human-authored threads but leave them open for
  the reviewer to close. Threads our own pipeline and known bots authored still resolve.
- **`--human-round`** — triage the human reviewer's comments instead of the bot round.
  `/review:human` Phase 2 passes it. **The Human Round** below states what changes.

## Example Invocation

```
/review:process                          # auto-detect PR from the current branch
/review:process 142                      # explicit PR
/review:process 142 --leave-human-open   # let humans close their own threads
/review:process 142 --human-round        # triage the submitted human review
```

---

## The Human Round

`--human-round` triages the review a person submitted in Linear. `/review:human`
Phase 2 hands it here once the review reaches the PR.

Triage is otherwise **identical to the bot round**: the same collector, the same
ticket check, the same head-commit check, the same scope routing, grouping and
sorting. There is no second triage path to look for. Four things change, and only
these four.

1. **Scope.** Collect the un-resolved items where `isBot` is false. Any human
   reviewer counts — the author most often, a teammate just as validly. Leave the
   bot items to the ordinary round.
2. **Validator exemption.** Human items are exempt from `review-bug-validator` and
   from `review-compliance-validator`. Both validators are fail-closed: each one
   drops the item it cannot confirm. A machine that silently drops a deliberate
   human read is the one failure this stage must not have. Phase 1 step 1 carries
   the same exemption, because its default sends external feedback to a validator.
3. **The `CONVERSATION` group.** Most human comments make no claim about a defect.
   *The `CONVERSATION` group* below states where they go.
4. **Zero items.** Report zero plainly and name the likeliest cause: a Linear
   review saved as a draft never reaches GitHub, so the pipeline cannot see it.
   Zero items is not by itself a clean review.

### Classification — the inbound vocabulary

Classify every human item with the **Conventional Comments** labels: `praise:`,
`nitpick:`, `suggestion:`, `issue:`, `question:`, `thought:`, `chore:`. Infer the
label from the comment by default.

An explicit prefix the reviewer wrote — `question:`, `issue:` — **overrides** your
inference. The reviewer stated the intent, so read it as stated.

An **ambiguous** item goes to `DISCUSS`, never to a silent fixer dispatch. Every
major tool asks for an explicit signal rather than guessing intent, because a false
positive costs more than a question does.

Route the labels: `issue`, `nitpick` and `suggestion` are claims about the code and
take the ordinary buckets. `praise`, `question`, `thought` and `chore` go to the
group below.

### The `CONVERSATION` group

`APPROVE`, `DISCUSS` and `SKIP` each assume the item is a claim about the code. A
question, an observation or a judgment call is not one, so it gets its own group.

Print `CONVERSATION` after the defect groups, in the order the reviewer wrote its
items. The group carries no `[SEVERITY]` tag. A question has no severity, and
ranking one against a BLOCKING defect invents a number.

Give every item in the group one of three dispositions:

- **`ANSWER`** — answer the item inline, in its own `Answer:` slot. An `ANSWER`
  stands by default, like an `APPROVE`. Where your answer implies a change to the
  code, the item **leaves `CONVERSATION`**: give it the `[SEVERITY]` that change
  carries and print it in `DISCUSS`, where the user rules on it. `CONVERSATION`
  carries no severity, so an escalated item has no group to print in until you
  assign one.
- **`ACKNOWLEDGE`** — praise. Reply to it and resolve it in Phase 5. Dispatch no
  fixer.
- **`TICKET`** — a chore or a todo for later. Offer it in the Phase 6 batch beside
  the reinforcements, and create the ticket only on the user's approval.

### Disagreement

Where you judge a human item wrong, mark the item `DISCUSS` and hold the gate.
State the trade-off in the item's own slots, because the user rules only on a
disagreement they can see. Dispatch no fixer on a change you believe is wrong.
Understand the item before you act on it, and state the trade-off rather than
comply or refuse.

---

## Phase 0: Collect

1. **PR number** — if not passed, follow **PR Number Auto-Extraction** in
   `.claude/skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md`. With no PR found, HALT and tell the user
   to push the branch and open a PR, or to pass the number.
2. **Repo and PR head** — `{owner}`/`{repo}` from
   `gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '{owner: .owner.login, repo: .name}'`, and
   `{headRefOid}` — the PR's head commit — from
   `gh pr view {number} --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid`.
3. **Dispatch `review-feedback-collector`** with the PR number, owner, and repo. It
   returns one normalized JSON array: every un-resolved GitHub item, keyed, with each
   item's `scope` already checked against the PR diff and `isBot` set. The fetch, parse,
   ref-keying, and diff arithmetic all live there — its contract is
   `.claude/agents/review-feedback-collector.md`.
4. **Conductor diff-comments** — read these from the **current conversation's
   attachments**; the Conductor MCP cannot fetch them, so the collector cannot see them.
   Normalize each to the collector's item shape with `source: conductor`. Under
   LaborForest + Solo this source is empty and GitHub carries all the feedback.
5. **Linear ticket context (body + comments).** Resolve every ticket id in the branch
   name and fetch each with `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` **and**
   `mcp__linear-server__list_comments`. Read the body *and* the full comment thread:
   comments record **deviations from the original plan** — a decision reversed, a scope
   cut, an approach changed mid-flight. Extract those into a short list you carry into
   triage. This is authoritative project intent and it **overrides** reviewer findings,
   convention defaults, and your own priors. With a ticket unfetchable, note it and
   continue.

Zero items across every source → say so and stop.

---

## Phase 1: Triage

Work the collector's list into the Phase 2 gate list, plus the skips and dismissals that
go straight to Phase 5.

1. **Weigh origin.** Items carrying the `/review:add` footer (`via /review:claude`,
   `Found by:`) already passed a per-finding validator inside `/review:claude`, which
   drops every finding it cannot confirm — **trust them as they stand**. Scrutinize only
   *external* feedback (human reviewers, general comments, Conductor diff-comments)
   against the **Convention Override Rule** and "Commonly false-positived conventions"
   in `.claude/skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md`. High-volume or low-confidence external
   feedback may go to the matching validator — `review-bug-validator` or
   `review-compliance-validator` — one item per dispatch, answered CONFIRMED or DROPPED.
   **In `--human-round`, every item is exempt from both validators.** Each validator
   is fail-closed and drops what it cannot confirm, and a deliberate human read that
   a machine deleted is the one loss this stage must not take.
2. **Check each item against the Linear ticket** (Phase 0 step 5). Where the ticket
   **endorses** what a reviewer flagged — the change was a deliberate, documented
   deviation — recommend **Skip** and cite the ticket comment; a settled call stays
   settled. Where the ticket **contradicts** the code — the code drifted from a
   documented decision — recommend **Approve** even at low severity. Name the ticket
   whenever it drove the call.
3. **Check each item against the PR head.** `/review:add` posts a finding against the
   commit that was head at the time, and the work often lands before this command runs,
   so treat every finding as a claim about the past until you confirm it against the
   present. Read the flagged code at the head commit `{headRefOid}` Phase 0 step 2
   fetched — `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={headRefOid}` — because the
   PR's branch may not be the branch you are standing on. Where the head already resolves
   the finding, mark the item **already fixed** and name the commit that did it. Trust the
   file over the ticket: a ticket that claims a fix is a claim about the past too.
4. **Route by scope.** The collector marked each item `in` or `out`. An `out` item at
   SHOULD_FIX / CONSIDER / NIT is **recorded as a skip** with the rationale "out of scope
   — PR did not create or modify this code" and resolved in Phase 5. An `out` item at
   BLOCKING joins the Phase 2 list under its own header. A `CONVERSATION` item carries
   no severity and matches neither branch, so it joins the Phase 2 list whatever its
   scope mark: a question about code this PR left alone is still a question the
   reviewer asked.
5. **Group** duplicates and relatives by `(file, line ±10, category)` — the key
   `/review:claude` Phase 3 merges on. A group is presented and fixed as one unit.
6. **Sort** BLOCKING → SHOULD_FIX → CONSIDER → NIT, by the `/review:add` badge
   (🔴/🟠/🟡/⚪) where present, otherwise by the contract taxonomy.
7. **Settle the dismissals silently.** An item you judge a false positive — or one that
   arrives already labeled dismissed (a ⚫ *Dismissed as false positive* badge from
   `/review:add` or CodeRabbit) — is **recorded as a dismissal** with its rationale and
   resolved in Phase 5. A settled dismissal needs no confirmation.

   Where the dismissal is wrong about a pattern the project deliberately uses and will
   keep using (`RefreshDatabase` / `Http::preventStrayRequests()` global in
   `tests/Pest.php`; DDD model placement; service-constant base URLs), **capture a
   reinforcement** so the same false positive stops returning every run. Capture one or
   both, then carry on — Phase 6 offers them in one batch:
   - **Convention registry** — the exact one-line bullet you would add to "Commonly
     false-positived conventions" in `.claude/skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md`, so our
     own reviewers stop raising it.
   - **External reviewer config** — for a CodeRabbit or other CLI-engine flag, the
     path-scoped rule for its config (e.g. `.coderabbit.yaml`).

Items marked `in`, every item with no file or line, the already-fixed items, the
out-of-scope BLOCKING items, and every `CONVERSATION` item go to Phase 2. Skips and
dismissals go straight to Phase 5.

---

## Phase 2: The Gate — one list, one reply, silence accepts

Present every item once, each carrying your recommendation and the reasoning behind it.
One reply settles the whole list: every recommendation stands unless an override names
its number.

This list is a **disposition list** — the rendering *Asking the user a question* in
`.ai/guidelines/project.md` defines for a batch of already-triaged items. The contract
there binds it, numbering included.

**Number the items globally `1..N`. A number is assigned once and keeps naming that item
for the rest of the session** — the Phase 6 summary, and any later round. A delta round
(`/review:run` Stage 5) **continues** the sequence rather than restarting at `1`, so the
user can still amend item 6 by number two rounds on.

Group by your recommendation — `APPROVE` (worth fixing, so do it) and `SKIP` (you would
drop it) — then `ALREADY FIXED` (the head resolves it, so it needs a reply and no work)
and the out-of-scope BLOCKING items, each last under its own header. Sort by severity
inside each group. Severity — `BLOCKING`, `CONSIDER`, `NIT` — is orthogonal to the
bucket, so a `CONSIDER` item is free to land in `APPROVE`. Print only the groups that
have items.

**Every item gets a side, including the close calls.** A close call you would rather put
to the user still goes in `APPROVE` or `SKIP`, filed by the way you lean, with the lean
written out in `Why` (below). You lose the option to defer; the user gains a list they
can settle in one reply, or in none.

In `--human-round`, the `CONVERSATION` group prints after every group above, in the
order the reviewer wrote its items.

Fill this shape verbatim, one entry per item:

```
APPROVE

1. [BLOCKING] Add `_tmdb_id` to the upsert conflict key. (claude, coderabbit)
   app/Domains/Catalog/Actions/UpsertTmdbMovies.php:88-94
   Issue: `UpsertTmdbMovies` matches an existing row on `_imdb_id` alone. TMDB carries
          movies that hold no IMDb id, so every sync run inserts those rows again.
   Fix:   Add `_tmdb_id` to the conflict key in the `upsert()` call.
   Why:   The table has no unique index, so nothing else stops the duplicates.

SKIP

6. [CONSIDER] Route the crosswalk parse through `SourceId`. (coderabbit)
   app/Domains/Catalog/Actions/ImportImdbTitles.php:141
   Issue: The action validates an IMDb id with an inline regex. `SourceId` is the shared
          normalizer that every other crosswalk parse site calls.
   Fix:   Replace the inline guard with `SourceId::imdb($raw)`.
   Why:   The guard predates `SourceId` and this PR leaves the file alone. I lean skip.

7. [NIT] Rename `$res` to `$response`. (coderabbit)
   app/Domains/Catalog/Services/TmdbApiService.php:52
   Issue: The variable holds a `Response`. Its siblings in the same class spell the
          name out in full.
   Why:   This PR leaves the line alone, so the rename is churn a reviewer must read.

ALREADY FIXED

8. [BLOCKING] Guard every step in `refresh.yaml` against the primary checkout. (claude, coderabbit)
   .laborforest/workflows/refresh.yaml:1
   Issue: `refresh` drops and reseeds the database it runs against. Run from the primary
          checkout it takes `lundflix`, whose catalog the committed dumps do not carry.
   Fixed: 39706da puts the primary-checkout `if:` on all three steps, and sweeps them
          in `LaborForestWorkflowTest`.

OUT OF SCOPE — BLOCKING (this PR did not touch this code)

9. [BLOCKING] Scope the tenant query on L40. (claude)
   app/Domains/Billing/Queries/TenantRows.php:40
   Issue: `TenantRows::all()` builds its query with no tenant clause. It returns every
          tenant's rows to whichever tenant asks.
   Fix:   Add `->where('tenant_id', $tenant->id)` to the builder.
   Why:   A fix here widens a PR that never touched this file. I lean skip — open a ticket.

CONVERSATION

10. ANSWER — Why does the collector key a body finding on `{ref}`? (jasonlund)
    .claude/agents/review-feedback-collector.md:64
    Issue:  The reviewer asks how a re-run knows it handled a review-body finding.
    Answer: A body finding carries no comment id and no resolve mutation. Phase 5
            writes the `{ref}` token into the reply footer, and the collector
            matches that token next run.
```

**Line 1** carries the number, the `[SEVERITY]` tag, the fix as a command, and who flagged
it in parentheses (the finding's `Found by:` list, or the reviewer's name for external
feedback). **Line 2** is the location, written as a **bare repo-relative `path:line`** —
the terminal linkifies a bare path only, so leave backticks, quotes and `@` off it. An
item with no line stops after line 1.

A `CONVERSATION` item carries no `[SEVERITY]` tag on line 1. It opens with the number,
then its disposition — `ANSWER`, `ACKNOWLEDGE` or `TICKET` — then the reviewer's own
question or remark, then who wrote it.

The slots below line 2 carry the substance. Every item states its issue and its
disposition; `Fix` joins them wherever a change is on the table:

| Slot | Appears on | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Issue:` | every item | Up to two sentences: what the code does, then what goes wrong. |
| `Fix:` | `APPROVE`, out-of-scope BLOCKING, and a close-call `SKIP` | One sentence naming the concrete change. |
| `Why:` | `APPROVE`, `SKIP`, out-of-scope BLOCKING | One sentence carrying the reason for your recommendation. |
| `Answer:` | `ANSWER` | Up to two sentences answering the item, plus the evidence the question asks for. |
| `Fixed:` | `ALREADY FIXED` | The commit that resolved it, and what that commit changed. |

A close call — and every out-of-scope BLOCKING item is one — closes `Why` with the
reasoning and then states the lean it is filed on: **"I lean approve"** or **"I lean
skip"**. The lean is your argument for that filing, so the user can overturn one number
instead of re-deriving the call.

**Those sentence counts are the whole verbosity budget.** Six lines is a long item.

Write every slot in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English, using this codebase's own
terms from `CONTEXT.md`, and **lead `Issue` with the context**: name the class, command,
or file and say what it does, then say what goes wrong. The user decides on a dozen of
these cold, so a finding that assumes they already hold the code in their head costs them
a trip to the file.

- **Context first, then the defect.** "`refresh` drops and reseeds the database it runs
  against" earns the sentence that follows it.
- **One topic per sentence**, ≤25 words, active voice, present tense.
- **Recommendations are commands** — "Add a tenant scope to the query on L40."
- **One word, one meaning.** Repeat the term exactly; elegant variation costs a re-read.
- **Quoted code and quoted ticket lines stay verbatim** — they are evidence.

The full spec is *How Findings Are Written* in `.claude/skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md`.

Then prompt once, as plain text. The list above is the disposition list's entries; this
prompt is the closing line the contract asks for. Every recommendation **stands by
default**, so the user replies only with overrides, as `<approve|skip> <numbers>` lines,
and the close says so outright — silence accepts what you recommended. In
`--human-round` the grammar carries the conversational dispositions too —
`<approve|skip|answer|acknowledge|ticket> <numbers>` — so one override line moves a
`CONVERSATION` item the way it moves any other:

```
Approve/skip stand as recommended — reply only with overrides.
No reply accepts every recommendation above.
```

Stop and wait.

**Final buckets = your recommendations + the user's overrides.** Apply each override
line, moving exactly the numbers it names; a later override for the same number wins. An
unnamed `APPROVE`, `SKIP`, or `ALREADY FIXED` number keeps your recommendation, and an
unnamed out-of-scope BLOCKING number takes the lean written on it. A bare number list
(`1 4`) approves those.

```
recommended:  approve 1 2 4 · skip 3 5 6 (6 lean skip) · already fixed 7
user:         skip 2 · approve 6
final:        approve 1 4 6 · skip 2 3 5 · already fixed 7
```

Every item ends as **approve**, **skip**, or **already fixed**. In `--human-round` a
`CONVERSATION` item ends on its own disposition instead — **answered**,
**acknowledged** or **ticketed** — each terminal in its own right, and none of them
dispatches a fixer. **Approve** dispatches (Phase 3); **skip** records its reason for
Phase 5. **Already fixed** stands unless the user approves the number — read that
override as "the head does not resolve this", so re-read the file before dispatching,
and say what you find either way.

Where the user asks about an item rather than ruling on it, answer in the item's own
slots — `Issue`, `Fix`, `Why` — so the answer reads like the entry it belongs to, and add
the evidence the question asks for. That answer is a fresh round in the same format, so it
closes the same way: the item stands as filed unless the next reply overrides it.

---

## Phase 3: Dispatch — parallel, foreground

Every fixer is a foreground `Agent` call. A `PreToolUse` hook
(`.claude/hooks/no-background-gated-subagents.js`) denies a backgrounded `review-fixer`, so each
result returns inside the dispatching turn and the harness never wakes you mid-flow.

Group the dispatched items into **waves where no two items share a target file** — the
files a comment points at, plus the obvious siblings a fix will touch. Two fixers editing
one file at once corrupt each other's work. Dispatch a wave as a single message holding
parallel `Agent` calls; they run concurrently and all return before the turn continues.
Usually one wave covers everything.

Each `review-fixer` gets the item or group, its target files, the resolution to reach, and
the standing constraints: touch only its files, run only filtered tests, leave global
formatters alone, and leave committing to the orchestrator.

Hold each returned blocker until every wave is back, then settle the held blockers inline
— re-dispatch with new guidance, or skip. Phase 3 ends when every dispatched item's fixer
has returned and every blocker is settled.

---

## Phase 4: Verify centrally

1. Read the aggregate diff and confirm each dispatched item landed as specified, against
   what each fixer reported: `git diff` (or Conductor's `GetWorkspaceDiff`).
2. Run the affected suites **once, here** — the one place safe from parallel clobber:
   ```bash
   php artisan test --compact --filter={affected}   # backend, if PHP changed
   npx vitest run {affected}                        # frontend, if JS/TS changed
   vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent           # style fix
   ```
3. Re-dispatch a fixer for anything red or unaddressed, or surface it to the user. A red
   suite stops the run here.

---

## Phase 5: Reply + resolve everything considered

Every item you considered gets a reply — fixed, skipped, dismissed as a false positive, or
out of scope. Resolving is what stops a future run reconsidering it, so out-of-scope items
get their reply and resolve too, whether or not they reached the gate.

- **Fixed** → a one-line summary of the change.
- **Already fixed** → the commit that resolved it and what that commit changed, so the
  reply reads as evidence rather than a claim.
- **Skipped / dismissed** → the rationale.
- **Answered / acknowledged** → the text of the item's `Answer:` slot, or a one-line
  acknowledgment for praise.
- **Ticketed** → the point is captured, and goes to the Phase 6 batch where a ticket opens
  only on the user's approval. No id exists yet, so the reply names none — and it is owed
  the same whether that batch opens the ticket or the user declines it.
- **Out of scope** → the out-of-scope rationale, and for a BLOCKING item, whether the run
  fixed it or left it.

Mechanics by source:

- **gh-thread** — reply, then resolve:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments -F in_reply_to={commentId} -f body='…'
  gh api graphql -F id={threadId} -f query='
  mutation($id:ID!){ resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){ thread{ isResolved } } }'
  ```
  Every thread resolves by default.
  **`--leave-human-open` holds back the resolve mutation on threads where `isBot` is
  false** — those keep their reply and stay open for the reviewer to close, while threads
  our own pipeline or a known bot authored resolve either way.
- **gh-review-body** — a body finding takes no reply and has no resolve mutation, so post
  a general comment whose footer carries the finding's stable `{ref}` from Phase 0. That
  token is what the collector matches next run to skip it:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments -f body='<result>

  _via /review:process · ref: review-body {ref}_'
  ```
  One `ref:` line per finding; batch several into one comment only when each keeps its own.
- **gh-comment** — reply only; a general comment has no resolve, so the reply's footer
  carries the item's `{commentId}` from Phase 0. That token is what the collector matches
  next run to skip it:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments -f body='<result>

  _via /review:process · ref: comment {commentId}_'
  ```
- **conductor** — reply on the same file and line with the `DiffComment` tool. Conductor
  comments have no programmatic resolve.

Close every reply with the footer marker on its own line:

```
_via /review:process_
```

**gh-review-body** and **gh-comment** extend that marker with the `ref:` token shown above
— `review-body {ref}` and `comment {commentId}`. Neither source carries resolved state, so
that token is the only handled-signal a re-run has. **gh-thread** resolves by mutation and
**conductor** resolves by hand, so both close with the bare marker.

---

## Phase 6: Reinforcements, then commit

**Offer the captured reinforcements once, as one batch.** List each registry or config
edit from Phase 1 with the exact line you would add and the re-flag it stops, and ask
which to apply (all / some / none). Apply the approved ones **in your own context** —
they are docs and config edits, so a `review-fixer` is the wrong tool. Skip this step
when Phase 1 captured none.

In `--human-round`, list every `TICKET` item in the same batch, each with the ticket
you would open for it. Create a ticket only on the user's approval.

Summarize the run:

```
✅ Processed review feedback on PR #{number}
- Addressed: {count}
- Already fixed before this run (replied, no work): {count}
- Skipped: {count}
- Dismissed (false positive): {count}
- Reinforcements applied (registry/config edits to stop re-flags): {list}
- Tickets opened from the batch: {list}
- Out of scope — skipped at triage (PR didn't touch this code): {count}
- Human threads left open for the reviewer: {count}   # only with --leave-human-open
- Files changed: {list}
- Tests: {pass/fail summary} · Pint: {clean/fixed}
```

**Committing is the user's call.** Prompt them to commit and push. On approval, commit
with a ticket-prefixed subject plus the co-author trailer the harness supplies for this
session — a hardcoded trailer stamps a model version that rots — then push.
