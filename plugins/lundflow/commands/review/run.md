# Review Loop Orchestrator

Runs the review pipeline as one guided sequence. Drive each stage **in order**,
pausing at the ⏸ gates for the user. Each stage's mechanics live in its own
command — **defer to that file, do not reimplement it here.**

Loop: `[cross-slice sweep?]` → `/review:create-pr` → `/review:debrief` →
`/review:human` → `/review:suite` → `/review:process` → `[delta review]`.

## Input
- **PR number** — optional, auto-detected from the branch.
- **Ticket ID** — `FLIX-XXX`, optional.

## Sequence

### Stage 0: Cross-slice refactor sweep (conditional)
Decide whether the branch spans **more than one TDD slice**. Ticket count is
irrelevant: `tdd-refactorer` is spawned per slice with only that slice's files
(`.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`, "Step 3 — REFACTOR"), so one ticket of many
slices has the same blind spot as many tickets. Expect this to fire **routinely, by design** — a
slice is only 2–6 tests (`.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`), so most non-trivial PRs
span several; a high hit rate is the gate working, not a misfire.

1. **Authoritative source — the tickets' TDD Slice Backlogs.** Resolve **every**
   `FLIX-\d+` id in the branch name, not just the first: read each body
   (`plan-slices` appends the backlog, one `### Slice N —` block per slice) and
   **sum** the slice counts across all of them. That sum decides. This is
   deliberately broader than Ticket ID Auto-Extraction
   (`.claude/skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md`), whose first-match-only rule names
   one ticket rather than counts work — don't lean on that contract here. A sum of
   **0** (no backlog, or a "zero TDD slices" verdict) means the backlog can't
   answer: fall through to step 2, then step 3 — never treat it as single-slice.
2. **`git status --short` is the secondary signal — only it sees the working
   tree.** At Stage 0 the branch is usually **not yet committed** (Stage 1 is what
   commits it), so `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat` reads committed history
   only and is routinely empty; run it when Stage 0 is **re-entered** and commits
   already exist. Neither maps slices to commits or files; use them only to
   corroborate the backlog.
3. **Still ambiguous → run the sweep.** A needless sweep costs one green-gated
   refactor pass; a missed one ships the duplication this stage exists to catch.

- **Multi-slice** → invoke the `review-tdd-cross-slice` skill (whole-PR REFACTOR
  sweep). It runs its **own** green-precondition + approval gate — let it.
- **Single-slice** → skip and say so (that one slice's own REFACTOR saw everything).

### Stage 1: create-pr  ⏸
If the branch has **no open PR**, follow `.claude/commands/review/create-pr.md`
(lint → commit → push → open). Show the drafted title/body and **pause for
approval before opening**. If a PR already exists, skip this stage.

### Stage 2: debrief  ⏸
Follow `.claude/commands/review/debrief.md` — plain-language summary of the branch +
ticket-scope check. **Pause** so the user reads it before the engines dig for
defects.

### Stage 3: human  ⏸
Follow `.claude/commands/review/human.md` — the Linear diff link, the wait while a
person reads the diff and submits their review, and the ingest of what comes back.
**Pause** for the whole read: the loop moves on only when the reviewer says they
are done.

**Why this sits before the engines**, so the next person to tidy the loop doesn't
move it after them:
- **A posted finding biases the reader.** Someone who has already scrolled fifteen
  engine findings checks that list instead of forming their own view of the branch,
  and the view is the only thing this stage is here to get.
- **The engines then review better code.** The structural objections a human raises
  are already fixed by the time they run, so the pass is spent on what survived
  rather than on code that was about to be restructured anyway.
- **Stage 4's suite covers whatever this round fixes**, which is why this stage
  needs no delta pass of its own the way Stage 5 does — its fixes land before the
  engines and the full suite have run, not after them.

### Stage 4: suite
Follow `.claude/commands/review/suite.md` — runs both engines (`/review:claude` +
CodeRabbit) and posts each to the PR as its own review. No pause — this is the
machine work.

### Stage 5: process  ⏸
**Before dispatching a single fixer, record the pre-fix commit:**
```bash
PRE_FIX_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```
Then follow `.claude/commands/review/process.md` — triage the posted feedback, present
one numbered list carrying your recommendations, take the user's overrides, dispatch
fixers. Already interactive.

### Stage 6: delta review  ⏸
**The fixes Stage 5 just landed have never been reviewed by anything.** The engines
in Stage 4 saw the pre-fix tree; the fixers that changed it were isolated subagents
each seeing one item. A bad fix ships with the same blast radius as any other bug,
and nothing upstream is looking at it. This stage closes that.

**Review only what we implemented — never re-review the whole PR.**

1. **Compute the delta.** `git diff {PRE_FIX_SHA}..HEAD`. Empty (every item skipped,
   or Stage 5 never ran) → skip this stage and say so.
2. **Re-run the deterministic gates** (Pint, Rector scoped to the changed files, the
   full Pest suite). Stage 5's fixers only ran filtered tests.
3. **Dispatch ONE focused reviewer** over that delta — `review-bug-hunter` by
   default, since fix regressions are overwhelmingly failure-mode bugs rather than
   convention drift. Give it:
   - the delta diff **as the only thing in scope** — state plainly that the base
     implementation was already reviewed and its findings resolved, so re-raising
     anything outside the delta is out of scope;
   - **what each fix changed and what it could plausibly break** — this is the
     highest-value part of the prompt. A fix that narrows a query can strand rows; a
     fix that reorders guards can change what runs on an early return; a fix that
     swaps a sort key can drop a tie-break. Name the specific suspicion per item.
   - the ticket context, and the pipeline contract's finding format + Comment Bar.
4. **Route any findings back through Stage 5's mechanics** — present each with your
   own recommendation, take Approve/Modify/Skip, dispatch a foreground fixer, commit.
5. **Then re-enter Stage 6 on the *new* delta.** Loop until a pass comes back clean.
   **Cap at 3 rounds**; if round 3 still finds real defects, stop and tell the user
   the fixes are churning — that is a signal to rethink the approach, not to keep
   patching.

Findings here are usually few. A clean pass is the expected outcome and takes one
agent over a small diff — cheap relative to shipping a regression introduced by a
fix the user already approved.

## Rules
- **One stage at a time.** Never skip a ⏸ gate.
- A stage that HALTs (no PR to review, no diff, etc.) **stops the loop** and reports
  why — it does not silently continue.
- **Defer, don't duplicate.** Each stage's logic lives in its command/skill file;
  this orchestrator only sequences and gates. Stage 6 is the one exception — it has
  no command file of its own, so its mechanics live here.
- **Every commit the loop produces gets reviewed before the loop ends.** Stage 6
  applies that to Stage 5's fixes; if you ever land code outside a stage, it needs
  the same treatment.
