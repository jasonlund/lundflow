# Worktree Down

One invocation from a finished branch to a suspended workspace:
**safety gate → `run-workflow down` → delete the Solo project → report.**

Teardown drops the workspace's MySQL database and unlinks its Herd site, so the safety
gate below is the whole point of the command.

## Input

- **Nothing** — the worktree you are standing in (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).
- **`FLIX-NNN`** or **a branch name** — tear down that workspace instead.

```
/worktree:down
/worktree:down FLIX-303
```

Run every `php artisan` call below **from the primary checkout** (`~/Sites/lundflix-v2`),
so a worktree with a deleted `vendor/` still reports.

---

## Phase 0: Preconditions

1. **`mcp__laborforest__*` tools are bound.** Absent → HALT, say so, and point the user
   at README's *Fallback: when the MCP doesn't answer*.
2. `mcp__laborforest__find-project-by-path` with `~/Sites/lundflix-v2` → the project
   `uuid`.
3. Read `laborforest://projects/{uuid}/workspaces` and pick the workspace: by exact
   branch, or — for a ticket id — the branch that starts with the lowercased id.

---

## Phase 1: Status gate

`suspended` is not one state — read `php artisan lf:run-log down --dir
<worktree>/.laborforest/ignored/logs` to tell its three apart. A `down` whose drop step
failed still exits 0 and still ends `suspended` (`ending_status: suspended`), so the one
workspace whose database survived teardown lands here too.

| State | Do |
| --- | --- |
| `ready` | Phase 2 |
| `suspended`, `No down run log …` | Never brought up: no database, no Herd site, nothing to tear down. Say that, name the GUI removal step from Phase 5, and STOP |
| `suspended`, log carries `[orphaned …]` | The last teardown left that database or site behind. `down` runs only from `ready`, so `mcp__laborforest__override-workspace-status(path: "<worktree>", status: "ready")`, then Phase 2 to retry the drop |
| `suspended`, clean log | Already down, nothing orphaned. Name the GUI removal step from Phase 5 and STOP |
| `error` | STOP. Read the verdict with `php artisan lf:run-log down --dir <worktree>/.laborforest/ignored/logs` — an aborted `down` lands in `error` too, and `lf:run-log` globs `*_{workflow}.yaml`, so asking for `up` here answers with the earlier successful provision. Fall back to `up` **only** on `No down run log …`. Report the failing step, plus `mcp__laborforest__override-workspace-status(path: "<worktree>", status: "suspended")` — leave clearing it to the user |

---

## Phase 2: Prove it is safe to abandon

**Safe = clean tree AND merged.** Shell out to git for both — LaborForest's own
`git_status` field reported `dirty` for three workspaces whose trees were clean and in
sync with origin, so read git directly.

```bash
git -C <worktree> fetch origin --prune
git -C <worktree> status --porcelain
git -C <worktree> for-each-ref --format='%(upstream:track)' refs/heads/<branch>
gh pr list --head <branch> --state merged --json number,mergedAt
```

- **Clean** — `status --porcelain` prints nothing. A `??` line counts as dirty: new
  domain files are routinely untracked, and those are exactly the ones worth keeping.
- **Merged** — the upstream reads `[gone]` **and** `gh pr list` returns a non-empty
  array. Both halves are required. A squash merge rewrites the branch into one new
  commit, so `git branch -r --contains HEAD` finds nothing and every branch commit reads
  as "ahead" — `--contains` alone calls merged work unmerged every time.
- **Ask about this branch, not this ticket.** `git log --grep=<FLIX-NNN> origin/main`
  searches every commit message in the whole history with an unanchored pattern, so
  nothing ties a hit to the branch in hand: a ticket that ships in more than one PR
  (`origin/main` already carries `FLIX-267/284:` and `FLIX-295:`) marks every later
  branch for it merged forever, and a short id matches a longer one — `FLIX-30` inside
  `FLIX-303:`. Pair either with a `[gone]` upstream and an unmerged branch passes the
  gate. `--head <branch>` cannot: `gh` is already this pipeline's tool, and it answers
  for this branch alone.
- **`gh` cannot answer** — unauthenticated, or the repo unresolvable — the merge half
  cannot be evaluated, so it counts as unmerged and the gate refuses.

### Both hold → Phase 3.

### Either fails → refuse and stop

Report which half failed and hand the decision back. Abandoning an unmerged experiment
is legitimate, so the escape hatch exists — and **only the user opens it.** Proceed on
an explicit instruction to tear down anyway, never on your own reading of the evidence.

```
🚫 Refusing to tear down {branch}

Clean tree: ❌ {N} uncommitted file(s), {M} untracked
Merged:     ✅ PR #{number}, merged {mergedAt}

Teardown drops `{database}` and unlinks {site URL}. Tell me to tear it down anyway and
I will.
```

---

## Phase 3: Run the workflow

```
mcp__laborforest__run-workflow(path: <worktree>, workflow: "down")
```

It only dispatches; the workflow runs asynchronously. Give it ~30 seconds, then read the
verdict:

```bash
php artisan lf:run-log down --dir <worktree>/.laborforest/ignored/logs
```

**The two destructive steps are best-effort and exit 0 by design.** A drop or unlink that
fails reports `[orphaned …]` and exits 0, because a non-zero exit would force the
workspace to `error` and LaborForest offers **Remove** only on a suspended one — a
failing step would make the worktree permanently undeletable. So an orphaned database or
site appears in step **output**, not in the exit code. `lf:run-log` surfaces those
`[orphaned …]` lines; carry every one into the report.

**The first step, `Derive workspace env values`, is the exception — it aborts the run.**
Its failure is not tolerated on purpose: without it the drop below runs against a stale
`.env`, which after an aborted `up` still names `lundflix`, and those rows are not
restorable from the dumps. It needs `vendor/`, so on a workspace whose `vendor/` was
deleted the run stops there.

**A non-zero exit is three answers, not one — read the line before routing.**

- **`No down run log …`** is a read that landed early rather than a failed run: the log
  lands only when the run ends, and a `DROP DATABASE` plus a `herd unlink` can outlast 30
  seconds. Wait another minute and read again. Still no log → report that the run has left
  no verdict yet and hand it back; whether to wait longer or give up is the user's call,
  and Phase 3a's `Orphaned:` line would be inventing an outcome the log has not given.
- **`The down run failed at '…'`** — a log naming a failing step is that abort → Phase 3a.
- **`The newest down run log records no successful run`** is a log too damaged to name the
  step: a run killed mid-write leaves exactly this, and so does a failing step the log
  never got a `name` onto. → Phase 3a, same stop. The log cannot be read as a finished
  run, and the drop step may already have gone through, so the teardown is unverifiable —
  and an unverifiable teardown stops rather than going on to delete the Solo project.
- **Exit `0`** → Phase 4.

---

## Phase 3a: Unfinished run — report and stop

**Stop before Phase 4.** A named abort stopped ahead of both destructive steps, so the
database and the Herd site are still there; a log that names no step cannot say whether
either ran. Either way the teardown is unproven, and deleting the Solo project now would
strip the worktree of its processes while leaving every resource this command exists to
reclaim.

```
❌ down did not complete — {step name, or "the log cannot name the step"}

{step output, when the log carries one}

Workspace: {worktree}  ·  status: error
Orphaned:  {database}, {site URL} — {the run never reached either step, or "the log
           cannot say whether either step ran"}
Solo:      project kept
```

Fixing the cause is not enough to retry — a run that did not finish leaves the workspace
in `error`, which cannot launch a workflow:

```
mcp__laborforest__override-workspace-status(path: "{worktree}", status: "suspended")
```

`suspended` is the state **Remove** needs, so it is the right call when the user is
giving up on the resources. Retrying the teardown instead wants `"ready"` — the status
`down` runs from — after the cause is fixed (a missing `vendor/` → `composer install`).
Name both and let the user pick; leave the override to them.

---

## Phase 4: Delete the Solo project

Delete it without asking — it is the exact counterpart of what `/worktree:up` created,
and Solo holds no process state worth preserving for a worktree about to be removed.
Name it in the report.

1. `mcp__solo__list_projects` returns a bare array; find the entry whose `path` is the
   worktree.
2. `mcp__solo__delete_project(project_id: <id>, confirm_delete: true, confirm_stop_running: true)`.

---

## Phase 5: Success report

```
✅ {branch} is down  ·  status: suspended

Dropped:   {database}
Unlinked:  {site URL}
Solo:      project deleted
{every [orphaned …] line lf:run-log printed}

Removing the worktree itself stays a GUI action: LaborForest exposes no
`remove-workspace` tool (`remove-project` deletes a whole project, not one workspace),
and it offers **Remove** only once a workspace is suspended — which this run is the only
path to. Finish in the LaborForest workspace row.
```

## Notes

- **User-invoked only.** This drops a database; it fires on your word alone.
- Sources this command drives without restating: the steps in
  `.laborforest/workflows/down.yaml`, README's by-hand fallback and its MCP tool table.
