/**
 * Fixture provenance: tests/Fixtures/LaborForest/up-success.yaml is a
 * byte-exact copy of a real LaborForest run log —
 * `.laborforest/ignored/logs/20260909T171446Z_…_up.yaml`, a successful `up` on
 * this branch — committed unedited. It is the only capture used here, and it is
 * used for exactly one reason: 13 of its 14 steps carry an `exitCode` and the
 * skipped one ('Generate the application key', `skip_reason: unless-matched`)
 * carries none at all. A verdict that reads a MISSING `exitCode` as a failure
 * calls every successful `up` run a failure, and no hand-written document would
 * have taught us that shape.
 *
 * Every other document below is an obviously-synthetic inline string: no failed
 * or aborted run exists to capture, and teardown's orphan lines only appear on a
 * run that lost a resource. A fabricated file pretending to be a capture would
 * be worse than a string that admits what it is, so each is kept minimal — the
 * one field under test sits beside its assertion.
