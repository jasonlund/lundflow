/**
 * Structure guard for `plugins/lundflow/commands/review/claude.md`.
 *
 * The command is prose an agent reads at dispatch time, so nothing else in the
 * suite can see it drift: a deleted gate, an agent name resolving to no file, or
 * a dropped report heading all fail silently at review time — hours after the
 * edit that caused them. This scans the committed file for the structural
 * commitments its consumers depend on.
 *
 * Scope, deliberate: every assertion here checks that an INSTRUCTION IS PRESENT,
 * never that a model obeyed it. A word cap and a fail-closed rule are enforced by
 * the model at runtime; the only thing a static scan can guarantee is that the
 * instruction was not deleted.
 *
 * The report contract is the sharpest of these and the only cross-file one: the
 * headings and per-finding fields it checks are what
 * `plugins/lundflow/commands/review/add.md` parses to build the PR review payload, so
 * dropping one silently empties a posted review.
 *
 * File reading, line counting and the named-pattern check come from
 * `Tests\Support\ToolkitFiles`, shared with the other toolkit guards.
 *
 * NB: every test carries a non-vacuous floor — the file was really read and is
 * really substantial — because a mistyped path yields an empty string, and an
 * empty string reads identically to a clean scan on several of these checks.
