/**
 * Drift guard for the local-development tooling config this repo commits:
 * `solo.yml`, `.mcp.json`, and the `.laborforest/workflows/*.yaml` lifecycle files.
 *
 * Every one of these is read by an external tool (Solo, the MCP client, the
 * LaborForest app) and by nothing inside this repo, so drift is silent: a process
 * added from Solo's UI, an MCP server registered on one machine only, or a file
 * left untracked all behave perfectly for the person who made the change and
 * reach nobody else. The tests below pin the decisions that have to survive a
 * fresh checkout.
 *
 * Scope limit, deliberate: the tracking test asks git whether a path is tracked
 * and nothing more, so a tracked file whose working-tree edits are never
 * committed still passes. Its path list names only the files this branch newly
 * commits — the ones previously reachable through a machine-local
 * `.git/info/exclude` line. `.mcp.json` is absent because it has been tracked
 * since FLIX-192 and was never at risk of that; its contents are pinned by the
 * server assertion below instead.
