/**
 * Reachability guard for the `/`-command surface under `.claude/commands/`.
 *
 * A command is prose the harness loads by name, so every way it can fail to
 * reach a reader is silent. It can be untracked — working perfectly for its
 * author behind a machine-local `.git/info/exclude` line and existing for
 * nobody else. It can declare a front-matter `name:` that no longer matches the
 * path it is addressed by, so the harness runs it under one name while the file
 * describes itself under another. Or it can simply go unmentioned in
 * `/map`, which is the router: a command absent from it is invisible, no matter
 * how well it works.
 *
 * Scope, deliberate: nothing here judges whether a command's procedure is
 * correct — only that the file reaches every checkout and can be found. The
 * procedure is proven by running it, not by scanning it.
 *
 * The tracking list names only the paths this branch newly commits. The other
 * command files have been tracked since they were written and were never at
 * risk of that; the two rules below cover all of them generically instead.
 *
 * NB: every test carries a non-vacuous floor — the scanned set is really
 * populated, the read file is really substantial — because a mistyped path or
 * glob yields an empty set, which reads identically to a clean sweep.

 * The path is the address — `ToolkitFiles::commands()` derives it — so the
