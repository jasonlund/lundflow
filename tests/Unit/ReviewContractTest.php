/**
 * Drift guard for the review engine's written contract: the toolkit must
 * describe the engine that actually exists.
 *
 * The review pipeline is prose an agent reads at dispatch time, so a retired
 * agent leaves no error behind when its name survives in a command or a skill —
 * the harness finds nothing to run, that phase produces no findings, and the
 * report still renders. The same holds for a contract section: a rule for a
 * phase that no longer exists reads as live guidance to the next agent that
 * loads the file, and to the next human that edits it.
 *
 * Five parts, all static: the **roster** (which agent files exist, and who
 * names them), the **contract** (which sections of
 * `plugins/lundflow/skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` survive, and what they say), the
 * **inventory** (whether `plugins/lundflow/skills/map/SKILL.md` — the router a human opens
 * to find a file — both counts and names the files that are actually on disk),
 * the **renames** (whether every file that routes to a renamed stage names that
 * stage as it is called now), and the **stage contracts** (whether a command
 * file carries the commitments the stage it serves is defined by — its own, or
 * a stage's whose work it does under a flag, the way
 * `/lundflow:review:process --human-round` is where the human stage's whole ingest is
 * written down).
 *
 * A rename goes wrong more quietly still. A retired name at least dangles —
 * the harness looks for a file and finds none. But a stage is renamed away from
 * a name because a later stage wants it, so a router left pointing at the old
 * name does not dangle: it resolves, to a stage doing something else entirely,
 * and the author is sent there instead.
 *
 * A stage contract fails more quietly again, because the file is there and
 * dispatches fine — only a step is missing from its prose, so the agent never
 * does it and nothing reports that it did not. If `/lundflow:review:human` stopped saying
 * that a Linear review must be submitted rather than drafted, the reviewer would
 * draft one, the collect would come back empty, and the loop would carry on to
 * the engines as though nobody had commented.
 *
 * Scope, deliberate: every assertion checks that TEXT IS PRESENT OR ABSENT,
 * never that a model obeyed it. A tier pin and a silence rule are enforced at
 * runtime by the harness and the model; the only thing a static scan can
 * guarantee is that the instruction was written, or that it was removed.
 *
 * File reading, line splitting, the agent-roster sweep and the named-pattern
 * checks come from `Tests\Support\ToolkitFiles`, shared with the other toolkit
 * guards.
 *
 * NB: the retired agent names live in a PHP array literal in this file, which
 * would make this file its own offender — so the scan excludes itself by
 * realpath. This is the one place those names are allowed to appear, because
 * this is the list that forbids them.
 *
 * NB: every test carries a non-vacuous floor — the scan really resolved files,
 * or the file really was read — because a mistyped path yields an empty scan,
 * and an empty scan reads identically to a clean one on every check here.
