/**
 * Drift guard for the one canonical procedure an agent follows when it asks the
 * user a question.
 *
 * The asking format used to be restated in every skill and command that asks —
 * six copies of a round template, none of them the source of truth. Copies drift
 * silently: an agent reading a stale one still renders a round, the user still
 * answers, and nothing reports that the format it used was superseded. So the
 * procedure is written ONCE in `.ai/guidelines/lundflow-workflow.md` and every asking site
 * points at it by name.
 *
 * Three commitments, all static: the guideline source carries the **section**
 * (heading, round template, silence contract), the **generated** agent files
 * carry its anchor, and every pinned **asking site** cites that anchor instead of
 * restating a format of its own.
 *
 * Four more make the ban enforceable rather than merely stated: the picker tool
 * is sanctioned nowhere on the instruction surface, no site keeps a private copy
 * of the round template, `/map` names the rule among the standing conventions it
 * routes to, and the `PreToolUse` guard that refuses the picker is both
 * registered in the plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` and documented in the hooks README. The
 * last one is the one that would otherwise pass on a script nobody wired in.
 *
 * The last three close the one hole the rest would leave open. A rule stated as an
 * **always** survives exactly as long as no site is allowed an exception, and
 * `/lundflow:review:process` had one: its `DISCUSS` bucket existed precisely so an item
 * would NOT stand on silence, and its Phase 2 gate held the whole run until the
 * user named every such number. Two contradictory contracts then govern the same
 * reply — silence locks, silence waits — and which one an agent follows is decided
 * by which file it read last. So the exception collapses: an item lands in
 * `APPROVE` or `SKIP` by the lean already written on it, four recommendation
 * buckets become three, and nothing in that command waits for an answer.
 *
 * Four more split the one thing all of that quietly assumed: that there is a
 * single asking FORMAT. There is one contract — durable numbering, a
 * recommendation per item, silence accepts — and two renderings of it. Planning
 * work renders a **decision round** (the `Qn` template, defined in the guideline
 * source and nowhere else); review feedback renders a **disposition list**
 * (`N. [SEVERITY]` over a bare `path:line`, with `Issue`/`Fix`/`Why` slots and a
 * lean), whose shape stays in `/lundflow:review:process`, its only user. Conflating the
 * two wrote a real contradiction into that command: it cites "the canonical
 * format" and then shows a different one — and it CANNOT show that one, because
 * the round glyph is single-sourced by the guard below. So the guideline section
 * has to state the contract apart from its renderings, no site may claim a single
 * canonical format, every site must name the rendering it uses, and the gate's
 * item numbers must be durable across rounds rather than scoped to one run.
 *
 * Scope, deliberate: every assertion checks that TEXT IS PRESENT, never that an
 * agent obeyed it. Whether a model actually asks in the canonical shape is a
 * runtime property no static scan can reach; what a scan can guarantee is that
 * the instruction exists in one place and that every site sends the reader there.
 *
 * File reading, line splitting and the named-pattern checks come from
 * `Tests\Support\ToolkitFiles`, shared with the other toolkit guards.
 *
 * NB: the round template's glyphs live in PHP string literals as escaped
 * codepoints, never as literal characters, so a later guard forbidding those
 * glyphs under `plugins/` can never read this file's patterns as an offence.
