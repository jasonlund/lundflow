/**
 * Drift guard for the plugins' internal reference graph.
 *
 * Skills and commands route work by naming each other's paths in prose. A path
 * that stops resolving — a renamed skill, a deleted command — produces no error:
 * the agent simply fails to load the file and carries on without the rules it
 * was supposed to read. Nothing else in the suite can see that.
 *
 * The scan root is `plugins/` — that is where the routing prose lives — but the
 * *targets* it checks are wider: a skill naming `.ai/guidelines/lundflow-workflow.md` or
 * `docs/agents/domain.md` dangles exactly as loudly as one naming a sibling
 * skill, so every prefix the toolkit points at is checked. Resolution follows where
 * an installed plugin's reader would actually look — `ToolkitFiles::resolveReference()`
 * carries the rules, and a `.claude/…` path never resolves.
 *
 * Scope limit, deliberate: this guard answers `file_exists` and nothing more, so
 * it catches a path that stopped resolving, never a pointer that dangles on
 * *content* (a file that exists but no longer carries the rule cited from it).
 * Scanning more source files buys no coverage of that second failure and only
 * makes a green run look like it did — fix content drift with a check that reads
 * the target, not by widening the Finder below.
 *
 * NB: the placeholder-bearing paths this file must ignore (`{Domain}`, `*.md`)
 * are excluded by the character class rather than a deny-list, so a new
 * placeholder style can never silently become an offender.
